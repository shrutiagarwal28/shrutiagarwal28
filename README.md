# 👋 Hi, I'm Shruti!

I’m a human on Earth 🌍 trying to make this world a better place for animals and other humans — by leveraging my engineering skills wherever I can.  
My journey has taken me through medicine, electronics, full-stack development, and now — into the fascinating world of AI.  

I’m diving head-first into this shift, partly to avoid becoming obsolete and mostly because it’s absolutely **mind-blowing**.  
It’s like having an expert sitting right beside you, answering all your questions — *without making you feel stupid*.

As a **Software Development Engineer**, I ship full-cycle features — from frontend to backend APIs, CI/CD integrations, AWS deployments, and infrastructure with Terraform.  
Yes, I **dev**, **test**, **deploy**, and **DevOps**. 🚀

---

Join me on my very human journey of transitioning from traditional full-stack to the new **AI-driven world**.  
Expect transparency, learnings, triumphs, and plenty of relatable missteps — because embracing new tech doesn’t have to be intimidating or perfect.

**Let’s figure it out together!**
