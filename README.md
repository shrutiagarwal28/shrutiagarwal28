# 👋 Hello, I'm Shruti!

## 🌍 Who am I?

I’m a human on Earth trying to make this world a better place for animals and other humans — by leveraging my engineering skills wherever I can.  
My journey has taken me through medicine, electronics, full-stack development, and now — into the fascinating world of AI.  

I’m diving head-first into this shift, partly to avoid becoming obsolete and mostly because it’s absolutely **mind-blowing**.  
It’s like having an expert sitting right beside you, answering all your questions — *without making you feel stupid*.

## 💻 What do I do?

I’m a **Software Development Engineer at JPMorgan**, building products within the Corporate Tech org.  
Previously, I worked at **Grubhub** on the **Search team** — improving how people find what they need (and probably what they’re craving 🍕).

I ship full-cycle features — from frontend to backend APIs, CI/CD integrations, AWS deployments, and infrastructure with Terraform.  
Yes, I **dev**, **test**, **deploy**, and **DevOps**. 🚀
